# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artemis Financial is a company that wanted to expand to offer their services online. Because of this they added more possible vulnerabilities which they wished to be prepared for.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
    Identifying all the possible vulnerabilities in the software is an important step and by properly planning and making use of best practices they can be kept to a minimum. By using multiple testing methods to inspect their software any vulnerability should be able to be caught and then patched. Secure code is important in protecting both the companys privacy and financial well being in addition to their clients.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
    Learning about different testing methods such as static testing, which I had not used previously myself, gave some useful insight into how I can help make sure that software I work on can be kept safe.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
    Making sure that there are no inputs or interactions with the software that do not go through some form of checks can help prevent unwanted behaviors and errors from popping up.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    Learning how to use Maven for static testing was a useful tool that I can see myself making use of in the future.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
    Generating a checksum with the SpringAPI would be the best example from this course since the assignment covered several different areas of security and coding.
